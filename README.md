# Python Web Scraping with Selenium lib

This project was developed to help a friend with his searches.

Your objective is acessing a url = "https://portal.cfm.org.br/busca-medicos/", copy the elements we want like "name","phone number" and "address" for exemple.

# Briefing

- access the url: https://portal.cfm.org.br/busca-medicos/

- Get name and phone number

- Copy it into a csv file.

# Why Selenium?

I'm using Selenium because we are handling with a single page aplication. The request to server is asynchronous.
